# Unit 2 - String and Math Methods

## Overview
This project is designed to help you practice and understand the usage of `String` and `Math` methods in Java. You will complete various methods that demonstrate your understanding of these concepts and then verify your implementations by running unit tests.

## Project Structure
- **Main.java**: This is the main class where you will complete the method implementations.
- **MainTest.java**: This class contains unit tests to check the correctness of your methods.

## Instructions

### 1. Setup
- Accept the assignment from the GitHub Classroom link provided in Google Classroom.
- Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces. (Or clone to your local machine and use your preferred IDE.)

### 2. Implement Methods
- Open `Main.java`.
- Complete each method in `Main.java` following the instructions provided in the comments.
- The methods you need to implement include:
  - `concatenateStrings(String str1, String str2)`
  - `calculateSquareRoot(double number)`
  - `toUpperCase(String str)`
  - `findMax(int num1, int num2)`
  - `getStringLength(String str)`
  - `roundValue(double value)`
  - `getSubstring(String str, int beginIndex, int endIndex)`
  - `getAbsoluteValue(int number)`
  - `replaceCharacter(String str, char oldChar, char newChar)`
  - `powerOf(double base, double exponent)`

### 3. Run Unit Tests
- Open `MainTest.java`.
- Run the unit tests to verify your method implementations.
- Make sure all tests pass before submitting your project.

### 4. Submit Your Work
- Once you have completed the methods and all tests pass, push your changes to GitHub.
- Make sure your repository is up to date with your final implementations.

## Grading
Your grade will be based on the correctness of your implementations as verified by the unit tests. Make sure all methods are completed and that all tests pass.

## Honor Code
Remember to adhere to the GSSM Academic Integrity Policy. Do not copy code from others or AI, and ensure all work is your own.
